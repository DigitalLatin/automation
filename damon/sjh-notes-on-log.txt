**5.1 (s(u/o)ffossa)**: Suffossa is the lemma, but she needs to indicate that witnesses have a difference of orthography here, which is why she uses "(u/o)".

**8.4 (aduersos (sc. impetus) ex munitionibus sustineri)**: "(sc. impetus)" is a note inserted by Damon for context.

**10.2 (accessissent (sc. nostri))**: "(sc. nostri)" is a note inserted by Damon for context.

**12.1 (et <gap>)**: I agree that we should not allow "<gap>". In the STAB for this, she prints ***. Replacing <gap> with *** should resolve the next entry in the log.

**13.5 (X (i.e., decem))**: The parenthetical is a note for context.

**14.1 (Rhodios (sc. e.g. classiarios))**: The parenthetical is a note for context.

**15.3 (Caesaris <moram>)**: Agreed that the regex is hard. This can be encoded manually.

**16.1 (illi (sc. hostes) tenerent)**: The parenthetical is a note for context.

**18.3 (oppidum enatauerunt multi tamen ex his capti interfectique sunt sed numerus captiuorum omnino fuit VI milium)**: This must be done manually. See <https://digitallatin.github.io/guidelines/LDLT-Guidelines.html#apparatus-criticus-basic-entry-cross-elements/>.

**19.6 (pugnabatur \xe2\x80\xa6 (24.2) ad hostes)**: I've asked Damon about this.

**22.1 (af(f)uerunt)**: The parenthetical indicates orthographical differences.

**22.2 (manum <gap>)**: Replace <gap> with \*\*\*.

**25.1 (itinere <ex>)**: Is it maybe expecting '&lt;ex&gt;'?

**25.5 (perforasset ac demersisset (sc. Euphranor))**: The parenthetical is a note for context.

**27.7 (adiuncti his)**: I have asked Damon about this.

**31.1 (tres (i.e., III))**: The parenthetical explains that 'tres' and 'III' are the same (i.e., orthographical differences).

**47.2 (consumpto post)**: I have asked Damon about this.

**48.1 (quod (sc. odium) uel)**: The parenthetical is a note for context.

**48.1 (animaduertere)**: I have asked Damon about this.

**48.3 (minuebat (sc. Cassius))**: The parenthetical is a note for context.

**49.1 (in ea (sc. prouincia))**: The parenthetical is a note for context.

**49.2 (coiciebantur)**: The main text has *coniciebantur*, not *coniciebatur*. This is one of those notes that doesn't report the lemma in a traditional apparatus criticus. That is, *coiciebantur* is a variant reading.

**52.1 (sestertios centenos)**: sestertios <centenos> is the lemma. Her apparatus is saying that she accepts Oudendorp's emendation, but she's making it clear that \<centenos\> has been supplied.

**52.2 (auersum (sc. Cassium))**: The parenthetical is a note for context.

**55.1 (cohortibus XXX (sc. legionum tricesimae, unetuicesmae, et secundae))**: The parenthetical is a note for context.

**55.2 (Minuci(i))**: (i) indicates an orthographical difference.

**57.2 (unetuicesimanorum (i.e., XXImanorum))**: The parenthetical indicates an orthographical difference.

58.2: The two entries here (sed ... coniectura and sed ... ferebat) will require special treatment, since transpositions are pretty involved. See <https://digitallatin.github.io/guidelines/LDLT-Guidelines.html#apparatus-criticus-transposition>.

**60.5 (uitii)**: I have asked Damon about this.

**63.5 (complanarent (sc. Lepidus Marcellusque))**: The parenthetical is a note for context.

**64.2 (obtinendam uenit)**: Damon thinks that uenit should be inserted into the text here. It is the reading of S.

**64.2 (nau(e/i)s)**: The parenthetical is a note for context.

**65.2 ((h)eae)**: The parenthetical is a note for context.

**66.4 (B(i/y)thino)**: the parenthetical indicates orthographical differences.

**66.5 (terreret <gap> Ariobarzani)**: <gap> should be ***

**67.1 (iae)**: Agreed that this is a mess. The parentheses indicate orthographical differences. I have asked Damon about the superscript 2.

**67.1 (tet(h)rarchae)**: the parenthetical indicates orthographical differences.

**73.1 (dubitanter)**: This appears to be a typo, probably from the previous entry, which ends with 'dubitanter'. The lemma should be 'munituras'.

**73.1 (si modo ea loca hostes priores non cepissent)**: The lemma should have '<non>'. The apparatus is reporting that M has 'non', but Damon thinks that it is an insertion.

**77.1 (eoque uel miles quoque)**: The lemma is 'eoque'. The apparatus is indicating that Kübler had two suggestions: eoque or miles quoque.

**78.2 (a quo rem)**: 'a quo rem' is Scaliger's conjecture. Damon has printed '<a> quo rem' to indicate both that it is a conjecture and that she accepts it.
