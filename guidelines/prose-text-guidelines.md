**Plain Text Guidelines: Prose**

1.  Overview

The purpose of this document is to establish guidelines for the .txt file used in preparing an LDLT edition of a prose text. These files should be plain text (i.e. .txt, not .rtf) and should be saved in UTF-8 encoding.

2.  Structure

Prose texts are divided into paragraphs and sentences. Paragraphs should be numbered sequentially at the beginning of the paragraph, with numerals only and no additional punctuation. Sentences should be numbered sequentially within the paragraph, with the number in parentheses, e.g. (1). Therefore, the beginning of a paragraph should look something like this: 
>1 (1) This is a sentence. (2) This is another sentence.

3.  Editorial Markup
    1. Editorial additions 
    
    Editorial additions should be enclosed in angle brackets <>, e.g. "these are some <added> words."
    2. Lacunae 
    
    Lacunae (i.e. places where the editor believes there is text missing) should be marked with three asterisks, e.g. "there is probably some \*\*\* here."
    3. Crux
    
    Sections which the editor believes are corrupted but chooses not to emend should be enclosed in daggers † †, e.g. "here is some †confusing text corrupted maybe†."
    4. Editorial deletions
    
    Editorial deletions should be enclosed in curly braces {} e.g. "these are some \{deleted\} words."
